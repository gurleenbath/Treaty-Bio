Motion data
I believe most of this will be filtered out.
The file names are time (after epoch) that the data was recorded. Files that end in an a are acceleration. Files that end in an w are angular velocity. The current version of main_test.py, does kmeans, logistic regression, and average change after given a command. It still has some bugs so I commented it out. I wanted to take more data but my phone over heated. (It's like 110 here.)
